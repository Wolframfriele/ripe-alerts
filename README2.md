<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is project is made by 5 IT-students of Hogeschool Utrecht and is commissioned by [RIPE NCC](https://www.ripe.net/).

Our main goal of this project is to find anomalies in the ATLAS network and report to the user. We currently report anomalies 
to the user by using a web server, but in the future we will also support webhooks and much more! 


* Request data from the atlas network
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
