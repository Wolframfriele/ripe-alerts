## Installation
The easiest way to install is to use Docker:
Make sure you have docker installed and running and have cloned the repository.

Remove line 11 from the `Backend/notifications/apis.py` file.
```python
  station = Station(PostgresInterface())
```

Run the docker-compose file.
```bash
  docker-compose up
```

Open a new terminal and ssh into the container.
```bash
  docker exec -it web-server bash
```

Migrate the database.
```bash
  python manage.py migrate
```

Create a superuser to access the database. (optional)
```bash
  python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Stop the container and uncomment line 11 in the `Backend/notifications/apis.py` file and build the container again.
```bash
  docker-compose down
  docker-compose build
  docker-compose up
```
It should be running now. you can access the site at `http://localhost:8080/`.
