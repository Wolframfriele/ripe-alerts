<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->



### Goal
Our main goal of this project is to find anomalies in the RIPE ATLAS network and report this to the user. We do this through various ways, including the following:

* Web server 
* ~~Webhooks~~ (still in development)
* Email 
* API

Currently, most of this is still in development. We will be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.

### Features

* Automatically analyze measurements from Ripe Atlas.
* View anomalies in a human-readable format
* Easily extend functionality with plugins
* Receive alerts via Email.

### Built With

We're currently using the following frameworks. 

* [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
* [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/)
* [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local server up and running, follow these steps.

### Prerequisites

To run this application, you'll need the latest version of Docker and Python installed on your computer. 


### Installation

1. After you've cloned the repository. Comment line #11 from the `Backend/notifications/apis.py` file. 
It will look like the example below.
```python
#  station = Station(PostgresInterface())
```
2. Build all component images with Docker, by using the command:
```bash
  docker-compose
```
3. Open Docker.
4. Start the application and go to the Webserver-container to open the Command Line Interface (CLI).
5. Migrate the database, by using the command:
```bash
  python manage.py migrate
```
6. To manage access to the database we need a superuser. So let's create one! <br/>
To create a superuser, use the command:
```bash
  python manage.py createsuperuser
```
7. After succesfully creating the superuser, stop the Docker container.
8. Now, go back to the project and uncomment line #11 from the `Backend/notifications/apis.py` file. <br/>
So it will looks like the code below.
```python
  station = Station(PostgresInterface())
```
9. Repeat step 2 and start the application.
10. Congratulations! It should be running now. You can access the site at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/).
